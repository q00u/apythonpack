# Stuff for Python

## These are the extensions I use for developing Python stuff

For [Visual Studio IntelliCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode):

1. Set up the Python extension by following the [Python tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_prerequisites)
2. Open (or create) a Python file. You should get a prompt to enable the Microsoft Python Language Server
3. Reload VS Code

After the language server finishes initializing, you should now see recommended completions

For [Mypy](https://github.com/matangover/mypy-vscode):

1. Create a virtualenv and install the mypy language server in it.
2. Reload VS Code

**Enjoy!**
